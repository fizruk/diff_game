DiffGame Install Guide
===========================

Requirements
------------

Sources for diff game are represented as Cabal package
and are written in Haskell programming language. So you
will need following to build program from sources:

* [ghc](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
* [Cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/) (system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs)

The best way to get both of them is to install

* [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/)

You also should install GUI libraries:

* [Gtk2Hs](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Gtk2Hs/Linux/)
* [Glade](http://glade.gnome.org/)

Install
-------

To install cabal package do the following:

    $ cd diff_game
    $ cabal install
