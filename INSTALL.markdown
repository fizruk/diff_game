DiffGame Install Guide
===========================

Requirements
------------

Sources for diff game are represented as Cabal package
and are written in Haskell programming language. So you
will need following to build program from sources:

* [ghc](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)

If you also want to build and install package, you'll need also

* [Cabal](http://www.haskell.org/cabal/) (system for building and packaging Haskell libraries and programs)

The best way to get all this in one simple move is to install

* [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/)

Install
-------

To install cabal package do the following:

    $ cd diff_game
    $ cabal install
